## Next steps
1) Writing the SOP collectively, invite more contributors 
2) 4 - 6 months Community review and GOOS endorsement
3) Submission to OBPS article to get doi
4) Submission of shorter version to [Frontiers: Research Topic Best Practices in Ocean Observing](https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/7173/best-practices-in-ocean-observing) for peer-review.

The main SOP document will always reside in this GitHub repository to allow updates within the OceanGliders community at any time. 
After major revisions regular updates are planned.
